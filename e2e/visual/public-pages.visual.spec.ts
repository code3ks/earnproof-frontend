 * Static, fully public marketing/info routes. No backend calls, no

 * Ownership: components/common/production-ui.tsx (MarketingHero,
 * FeatureGrid, MetricGrid, DataPanel, StatusBadge) and
 * components/layout/public-shell.tsx, public-nav.tsx, public-footer.tsx
 * back every route below — a diff on more than one route at once usually
 * means one of those shared components changed.
