/**
 * Triggers a payment synchronization pass (#138). `POST /payments/sync`
 * is a mutation and is intentionally never auto-retried by this client
 * (see retryMutation), matching this API's documented retry policy.
 *
 * The response is a one-shot summary (created/updated/skipped counts);
 * the API does not expose a resumable cursor or a separate progress/status
 * endpoint, so callers can distinguish a completed sync's outcome
 * (no-op / partial / full) from these counts, but cannot resume a sync
 * from a server-provided checkpoint mid-run, only retry the whole
 * operation.
 *
 * POST /payments/sync (#171). The real endpoint takes no parameters and
 * runs a full, unbounded, synchronous sync — it has no concept of a ledger
 * range, a queued/async job, or resumable progress. See
 * lib/payment-backfill/store.ts for how the bounded-range request/job
 * lifecycle this issue asks for is layered on top of this call.
